# qWC
Emulation and extension to âŽ•WC from Dyalog APL

Take the Examples.pdf as they give examples of most of the controls

To install take the Zip and extract Output dir

If on Windows it goes to c:/Dyalog/cmd/QWC/Output no config changes are needed
Copy the two files QWC.dyalog and QWC.dcfg from Output to your User Command folder - see Dyalog's User Command manual for details

If the directory is different then the config QWC.dcfg will need to be edited

On a Mac dpownload rthe same files

Place the Output in a directory say as /Users/id/Output
Put the QWC.dyalog and QWC.dcfg into /User/id/MyUCMDs and edit QWC.dcfg with the path and set the browser to Safari

We are having rouble getting Safari to start so as a temp soln you need to enter qSafari '' after
* Client Server started on port 1236

  Type qSafari ''
  You should then get *** User Id set to 1

  In the other Window after * Attemptingh to connect to the Client Web Socket
  you shoukd get

  * qWC Initialized
 
    If so you are good to use the window after * qWC Initialized

    MORE INFO will be added asap but we will help you with the installation.
